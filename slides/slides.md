Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, <br/>
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;

Weep o’er the erring one, lift up the fallen, <br/>
Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.

still He is waiting, <br/>
Waiting the penitent child to receive;

Plead with them earnestly, <br/>
plead with them gently; <br/>
He will forgive if they only believe.

Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;

Touched by a loving heart, <br/>
wakened by kindness, <br/>
Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.
