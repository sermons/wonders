Before the throne of God above <br/>
I have a strong, a perfect plea:

A great High Priest, whose name is Love <br/>
who ever lives and pleads for me.

My name is graven on His hands, <br/>
my name is written on His heart;

I know that while in heav'n He stands <br/>
no tongue can bid me thence depart; <br>
no tongue can bid me thence depart.

When Satan tempts me to despair <br/>
and tells me of the guilt within,

Upward I look, and see Him there <br/>
who made an end of all my sin.

Because the sinless Savior died, <br/>
my sinful soul is counted free,

For God the just is satisfied <br/>
to look on Him and pardon me; <br>
to look on Him and pardon me.

## #441 Rescue the Perishing
Fanny Crosby

Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, <br/>
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

******
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, <br/>
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;

Weep o’er the erring one, lift up the fallen, <br/>
Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.

******
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, <br/>
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

******
Though they are slighting Him, <br/>
still He is waiting, <br/>
Waiting the penitent child to receive;

Plead with them earnestly, <br/>
plead with them gently; <br/>
He will forgive if they only believe.

******
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, <br/>
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

******
Down in the human heart, <br/>
crushed by the tempter, <br/>
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;

Touched by a loving heart, <br/>
wakened by kindness, <br/>
Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.

******
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, <br/>
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

******
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it; <br/>
Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;

Back to the narrow way patiently win them; <br/>
Tell the poor wand’rer a Savior has died

******
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, <br/>
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, <br/>
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.
